# PageRanking

PageRank is an algorithm used to measure the importance of website pages using hyperlinks between pages!

The aim of this algorithm is track some difficulties with the content-based ranking algorithms of early search engines which used text documents for webpages to retrieve the information with no explicit relationship of link between them.

The implementation of this algorithm in Python provides a great opportunity for anyone interested in learning about or working on search engines, machine learning, data science, or related fields. This code can be used as a starting point for research, experimentation, and further development of search engine algorithms.

The repository includes a Python script that calculates the PageRank score for a given set of web pages, and it also includes a sample dataset of web pages. The implementation of the algorithm is based on the original PageRank paper by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, which can be found in the references.

I hope you find this repository useful and informative.
